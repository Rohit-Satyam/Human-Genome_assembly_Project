## Human Genome Assembly: Defining the staircase towards complete genomes

###  Scope: 
The sole purpose of writing this review is 
1. to gain insights into the steps involved in Human Genome Assembly using either Denovo, reference guided or hybrid approach.
2. Try to understand & communicate the appropriateness of either of the methods in different scenarios, their shortcomings and benefits etc.
3. Seiving out the state-of-the-art assemblers/pipelines for our own benchmarking study.
4. Discussing the progress and challenges still pending in the field of human genome assembly.
5. Developing a step by step protocol, discussing each steps in greater detail, for each type of assembly while trying to establish the Best Practices for human genome assembly.
6. Special section on mitochondrial genome assembly and methodology involved
7. Discussing about assembly annotation and challenges
8. Get educated on what steps must we perform benchmarking and what steps should we use the results from existing literature.
